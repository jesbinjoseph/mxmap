"""Mail sovereignty classifier: aggregate evidence and classify domains.

Two-phase algorithm:

1. **Winner selection** — For each provider that appears in the evidence, sum
   the weights of its *primary* signals (MX, SPF, DKIM, AUTODISCOVER).  The
   provider with the highest total wins.  If no provider has any primary
   signal, the domain is classified as INDEPENDENT.

2. **Confidence scoring** — The winning provider's signal set is matched
   against a rule chain (see ``_rule_confidence``).  The highest-matching rule
   sets a base confidence; each additional signal beyond the rule adds a small
   boost (0.02).  The final score is capped at 1.0.

Signal hierarchy:
    - **Primary** (MX, SPF, DKIM, AUTODISCOVER): can elect a winner on their
      own.  MX and SPF are the strongest; DKIM and AUTODISCOVER are weaker but
      still primary.
    - **Confirmation-only** (TENANT, ASN, SPF_IP, TXT_VERIFICATION, …): cannot
      elect a winner alone, but boost confidence when paired with a primary
      signal from the same provider.
    - **TENANT** has a special restriction: it is only treated as a
      confirmation signal when the winning provider is MS365.
    - **Gateway** (detected from MX hostnames) is not a ``SignalKind``; it
      participates in rule matching but never contributes to boost.
